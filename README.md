This repository will act as a learning course for the labproject of our school.
It is done personnaly by me so i can later update the project on the other repo with a back-end server once this repo works.
The techno used will be PostGres, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS.
I will replace MongoDB which was originally in the MERN app with Postgres.
